Getting started
---------------

- Download the [latest release (v1)](https://github.com/bdoughton/vba-jira/releases)
- The project is composed of an MS Excel Add-in: `vba-jira.xlam` with a CustomUI Ribbon and associated excel templates:
    - Metrics: `ScrumTeamStats.xlsx`

Notes

Modules are structred as follows:
- `Jira.bas`: Common Jira functions 
- `JiraAgile.bas`: Functions for exporting/updating Jira Agile boards to the active worksheet
- `JiraScrumTeamStats.bas`: Functions for compiling metrics (see associated excel template)
- `JiraAffinityEstimation.bas`: Functions for exporting/udating Story Porint estimates for Jira issues

Before commiting changes to Git the source code should be exported from the Visual Basic editor to the src directory. The following <a href="https://www.xltrail.com/blog/auto-export-vba-commit-hook">post</a> from Bj√∂rn Stiel explains some useful options for automating this.
